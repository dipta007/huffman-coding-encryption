## Encoding

To run encoding, you need to provide a text file.

```
$ python encode.py filename
```

## Decoding
To run decoding, you need to provide a encoded file generated from previous step.

```
$ python decode.py filename
```

## Comparing
To compare the encoding and decoding results, you need to provide two files - one the input file and the other the decoded file.


```
$ python compare.py filename1 filename2
```
